Here are some images documenting my creation of these robots.

While you might think that this robot is not the prettiest robot you have ever seen, I must disagree.

This is only a "works-like" prototype, and I am currently working on the CAD Models to fully print a "looks-like" prototype, something that will look like a high end product. See CAD Models folder to view what I am trying to get this little guy to look like.

It does however contain all of the functionality I was hoping for, including lidar based naviagation and 4 wheeled tank steering.
