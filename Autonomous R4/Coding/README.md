This is my current working code for AR4, the A4AutoMain file can be uploaded, and will navigate around a house, using a basic wall detection algorithm. 

A4 Auto controller uses espNow to connect to the robot, use for debugging and for remote control of the motors and head.

testrun.ino is old code that works, and should just be used for a reference of working pins.
