# Engineering Projects Repository

This repository is a curated collection of engineering-related projects that I use to document my technical work, learning process, and personal interests. It serves as a living archive of projects spanning electronics, mechanical design, embedded systems, and fabrication.

The contents include a mix of schematics, source code, CAD files, images, and build notes. Some projects are fully realized builds, while others are exploratory or iterative prototypes created to better understand specific engineering concepts or tools.

At its core, this repository reflects the kind of work I enjoy doing both professionally and as a hobby—designing, building, troubleshooting, and refining physical systems. It is intended both as personal documentation and as a transparent overview of my hands-on engineering experience.

Feel free to poke around and take a look at some of my favorite projects!
